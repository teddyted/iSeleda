/**
 * This provides some alternative implementations of a few methods from
 * the Math class.
 * <P>This class may use approximations with various levels of error.  The "G"
 * in the name stands for "Graphics", because it was originally conceived
 * as a tool to speed up graphics.  When I iterate over every pixel in an image
 * to perform some operation: I don't really need the precision that the Math
 * class offers.
 * <P>Many thanks to Oleg E. for some insights regarding machine error and
 * design.
 * <P>See MathGDemo.java for a set of tests comparing the speed/accuracy
 * of java.lang.Math and com.bric.math.MathG.
